# Engine rebuilds and teardowns
You could say I'm a car enthusiast, especially when it comes to internal combustion engines.
I wanted to have an old car I could fix and modify, a project car, but my basement didn’t have enough space to work on a car comfortably, and I didn't have the funds. So I had to stick to something smaller and cheaper: engines.
I bought a cheap engine stand and I was gifted a basic set of tools, which to be honest is the best way to get started on wrenching on cars. You get to understand every single part, from the main rotating assemblies to the little quirks and features of each individual engine, as well as the manufacturing processes and philosophy each brand takes on. Although I already kind of knew almost everything there is to know about an average street car engine thanks to YouTube videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Donut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donut</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@chrisfix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChrisFix</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RobDahm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Dahm</a> (the absolute legend when it comes to rotary engines), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@d4a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">driving 4 answers</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EngineeringExplained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Engineering Explained</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AngeTheGreat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AngeTheGreat</a> (and his cool 2D engine simulator).

Up to this point I have rebuilt one engine, and torn down the exterior of another one. Keep reading to see how that went.

## Volkswagen 6N1
This was the first engine I've ever rebuilt. It's a 1.4 liter, 8 valve SOHC, 4 cylinder that you can find in Mk3 VW Polos. It's a really easy engine to work on, as everything is easy to access, and doesn't require specialized tools, except for the head bolt socket, which I had to borrow twice from a mechanic. I got this engine as a gift from a friend of my father, and it wasn't in it's greatest shape: it didn't come with a flywheel, a starter motor, the wiring harness, or the ECU. On top of that, this engine was used at a professional formation school, so it had been rebuilt before, but not very well: some bolts and nuts had been replaced with random ones, most piston rings were missing, seals were broken, and the overall condition of the engine wasn't great. I could've spent around 200€ to 300€ replacing everything that was broken with a mix of junkyard and new parts to make it run, but I didn't want to spend that kind of money on an engine I knew would go to the junkyard anyway. In conclusion, this little 4 cylinder is great when it comes to learning how to rebuild an engine.
