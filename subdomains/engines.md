# Engine rebuilds and teardowns
You could say I have a deep passion for cars, especially when it comes to internal combustion engines.
I wanted to have an old car I could fix and modify, a project car, but my basement didnâ€™t have enough space to work on a car comfortably, and I didn't have the funds. So I had to stick to something smaller and cheaper: engines.
I bought a cheap engine stand and I was gifted a basic set of tools, which to be honest is the best way to get started on wrenching on cars. You get to understand every single part, from the main rotating assemblies to the little quirks and features of each individual engine, as well as the manufacturing processes and philosophy each brand takes on. Although I already kind of knew almost everything there is to know about an average street car engine thanks to YouTube videos from Donut, Chrisfix, Rob Dahm (the absolute legend when it comes to rotary engines), driving 4 answers, Engineering Explained, and AngeTheGreat (and his cool 2D engine simulator) (+ Add links to yt channels). Honorable mentions go to Nightride, StanceWorks, and Gears and Gasoline, which have been great inspiration for taking on projects like these and for eventually wanting to restore and modify a car.

Up to this point I have rebuilt one engine, and torn down the exterior of another one. Keep reading to see how that went.
