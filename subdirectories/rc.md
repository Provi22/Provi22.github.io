# 3D Printed RC Car

---

## Initial Idea
I wanted to create a drift RC car on my own from scratch. The goal was to build a budget RC car, since it seemed cheaper than buying one from AliExpressâ€”although the battery alone ended up costing about as much as an entire RC drift car. In the end, this project was a fun way of learning how to code an ESP32, create a local WiFi network, control a microcontroller with my phone, and improve my 3D printing skills. I used this guide from <a href="https://dukedoks.com/portfolio/guia-chasis-rc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DukeDoks</a> to 3D print and assemble the chassis, and designed and built the electronic circuit myself.
