# Future projects
Currently I have no more projects planned, since I still have to finsh the RC car, and I don't want to get overwhelmed with my studies, although I recently aquired a PSP and I might invest some time into it by fixing it's optical drive reader (UMD drive), jailbreaking it and maybe modding it some more. I might apply for <a href="https://racingcareers.mclaren.com/early-careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McLaren Early Careers</a> or <a href="https://careers.williamsf1.com/work-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Williams Racing Work xperience</a> in the near future, though I haven't decided yet.
